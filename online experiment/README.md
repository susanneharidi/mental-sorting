Online Experiment.

The scripts here no longer save data (all php scripts and the corresponding lines in the html files that were necessary to connect to teh database have been removed to protect our database). They serve as a reference for what teh participants saw and how the Stimuli were generated. You are however welcome to resuse them for your own purposes.

The first Script was the "index_1.html" script. This script will automatically guide you through the whole experiment, including comprehension checks, practice trials and debriefs.
