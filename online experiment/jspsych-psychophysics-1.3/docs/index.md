jspsych-psychophysics is a plugin for conducting Web-based psychophysical experiments using [jsPsych](http://www.jspsych.org/) (de Leeuw, 2015).
This plugin can be used free of charge under the MIT license.

Please cite [de Leeuw's paper (2015)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-014-0458-y) and [mine](https://rdcu.be/b5Nie) when you report your research using the jspsych-psychophysics plugin.

## What you can do with the jspsych-psychophysics plugin
- You can present a set of stimuli asynchronously. In other words, the plugin can specify stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs).
- You can present visual stimuli (e.g., image, line, rectangle, circle, and text) at intended coordinates. You can also present moving objects and play sound files.
- This plugin presents visual stimuli synchronized with the refresh of the display using the **requestAnimationFrame** method. As a result, the display duration is expected to be more accurate.
- The position of the mouse click can be recorded as a response.
- According to my observation, the SOA between visual stimuli with the plugin was more accurate than that without the plugin ([Kuroki, 2020](https://rdcu.be/b5Nie)).

## How to use the jspsych-psychophysics plugin
This is the brief explanation how to use the plugin. Please refer to [the parameters of the plugin](pluginParams.md) and [the properties of the object](objectProperties.md) in detail.

This figure illustrates a trial flow to be made by this tutorial.

You can see [the sample of this tutorial.](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/tutorial.html)

### 1. Download the plugin package.
[Please download the latest files from GitHub.](https://github.com/kurokida/jspsych-psychophysics/releases)
The package includes the comaptible [jsPsych](http://www.jspsych.org/) (de Leeuw, 2015), and released under [the MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


### 2. Include the plugin file using the `<script>` tag

```javascript
<script src="jspsych-psychophysics.js"></script>
```
This procedure is the same as other plugins are used with the jsPsych. Note the location of the plugin file.

### 3. Specify all the stimuli used in the program as a JavaScript object

```javascript
var rect_object = {
    obj_type: 'rect', // means a rectangle
    startX: 200, // location in the canvas
    startY: 150,
    width: 300, // of the rectangle
    height: 200,
    line_color: '#ffffff',
    fill_color: '#ffffff',
    show_start_time: 500 // from the trial start (ms)
}

var circle_object = {
    obj_type: 'circle',
    startX: 500, // location in the canvas
    startY: 300,
    radius: 100,
    line_color: 'red', // You can use the HTML color name instead of the HEX color.
    fill_color: 'red',
    show_start_time: 1000 // from the trial start (ms)
}
```

The origin of the coordinate is the top left of the canvas, but the origin can be changed to the center of the window using the `origin_center` property. The unit is the pixel. 

The color can be specified using the HTML color names, hexadecimal (HEX) colors, and RGB values that are often used in a general HTML file.

The **show_start_time** is the most notable property in this object, which enables to present the stimulus at the intended time. In this example, a white rectangle is presented 500 ms after beginning this trial, after another 500 ms, a red circle is presented until the response.

### 4. Specify a trial object including the stimuli in the jsPsych's timeline

```javascript
var trial = {
    type: 'psychophysics',
    stimuli: [rect_object, circle_object],
    choices: ['y', 'n'], // The participant can respond to the stimuli using the 'y' or 'n' key.
    canvas_width: 1000,
    canvas_height: 800,
    background_color: '#008000', // The HEX color means green.
}

jsPsych.init({
    timeline: [trial],
    on_finish: function(){jsPsych.data.displayData();}
});
```

The **stimuli** property must include all the objects to be presented in the trial.

This trial object must be included as the **timeline** property of the jsPsych.init which is a core function of the jsPsych.

Note that if you use image and audio files in a trial, please preload them using the preload_images and preload_audio methods in the jsPsych.init. See, [demos/randomizedImages.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/randomizedImages.html) and [demos/twoSoundsWithSOA.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/twoSoundsWithSOA.html). 

Furthermore, the other applications and the tabs in the browser should be closed during the experiment. This should be informed as an instruction at the begging of the experiment.
