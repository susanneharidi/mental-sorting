            <h4> Informed Consent Form </h4>
            <p> This is a psychology experiment conducted by Eric Schulz, group leader of the Computational Principles of Intelligence Lab at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics and the members of his lab. As mentioned on the MTurk page before you accepted the HIT, you MUST meet the following criteria to participate in the experiment:</p>
            
            <b> 18 years of age or older. <br></b>
            <b> Fluent speaker of English. <br></b>
            <b> Have not previously participated in this experiment. <br></b>

            <p><br>This study is designed to investigate how people learn and make decisions. In this task, you will be asked to perform a sorting task and answer questions regarding the task. The study will take about <b>30-40 minutes</b> and will pay a base fee of <b>$3.00</b> plus a performance-dependent bonus of up to <b>$8.00</b>. The performance bonus is explained in more detail in the instructions that follow. </p>


            <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time without penalty by exiting this task and alerting the experimenter either via MTurk or via the e-mail address below (please be sure to provide your MTurk ID). You may choose not to complete certain parts of the task or answer certain questions. You may contact us at the address provided below if you have additional questions or concerns. </p>

            <p>Other than monetary compensation, participating in this study will provide no direct benefits to you. But we hope that this research will benefit society at large by contributing towards establishing a scientific foundation for improving people’s learning abilities.</p>
            
            <p>Your online username may be connected to your individual responses, but we will not be asking for any additional personally identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. We cannot, however, guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. We will be keeping deidentified data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. Data used in scientific publications will remain completely anonymous.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about the study, feel free to contact our lab. Dr. Schulz and his labmembers can be reached at <font color="blue">cpilab@tuebingen.mpg.de</font>. </p>

                    <li>the processing and use of the collected data occurs in a pseudonymised form within the scope of the legally prescribed provisions.
                        As a general rule, the storage occurs in the form of questionnaires, as well as on electronic data media, for a duration of 10 years
                        or longer, if this is required by the purpose of the study.</li>
                    <li>by providing of further personal data in pseudonymised form, collected personal data may be used for the preparation of anonymised
                        scientific research work and may also be published and used in an anonymised form in medical journals, scientific publications
                        and publicly accessible scientific databases, so that a direct assignment to my person cannot be established.</li>
                    <li>the information obtained during the course of this study may also be sent in an anonymised form to cooperation partners within the
                        scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation for scientific purposes and to cooperation partners outside of the
                        European Union, i.e. to countries with a lower data protection level (this also applies to the USA).</li>

                <h3>Structure of the Experiment:</h3>
                <p><b>Thank you for participating in our study! </b></p>
                <p><b>Please read the following instructions very carefully. You will be tested on your understanding later. </b></p>
                <br>
                <p>In the following, we will tell you how the study is structured and what you will have to do.</p>
                <p>The study consists of 5 parts: <br><br></p>

                <p><b>1. Experiment instructions and practice trials. (~5 min)</b></p>
                <p>In this first part, we will explain how the experiment works and let you practice the task on a few trials.<br><br></p>

                <p><b>2. Comprehension questions. (~1 min)</b></p>
                <p>After the practice trials we will test your understanding of the task with three short questions. </p>
                <p>You will need to get these questions right to continue on to the main experiment, so please read the instructions carefully. <br><br></p>

                <p><b>3. Experiment. (~20-30 min)</b></p>
                <p>After the comprehension questions the main experiment will start. Your bonus will depend on the percentage of trials you get correct in this part. </p>
                <p>But please also be as <b>fast</b> as possible.<br><br></p>

                <p><b>4. Colorblindness test. (~1 min)</b></p>
                <p>As mentioned in the HIT description, this experiment requires you to be able to destinguish between the colors shown below.</p>
                <p>If you have trouble differentiating these colors, you can stop the task and return to the HIT at no penalty.<br><br></p>
                <img border="0" src="Stimuli/farben.png" align="center" style="width:600px;height:70px;"><br><br><br>

                <p><b>5. Demographic questions. (~1-2 min)</b></p>
                <p>At the very end we will ask you to answer a few final questions, before we send you off with the completion code you need to claim your payment.<br><br><br></p>
